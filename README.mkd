RTSP Streaming.js
=================

This package uses FFmpeg to convert a RTSP streaming to a stale JPEG 
image and with JavaScript this file is read at a frequency and sent
through Socket.IO to the client so it read the `<img>` tag in the HTML
as a `<video>` without needing a state-of-the-art browser.

Thanks to Socket.IO cross-browser and cross-platform compatibility this
can be used even for mobile clients.
